        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Window Object</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>
            <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
            <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.</li>
            <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
            <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>
            <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.</li>
            <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
            <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.</li>
            <li>The audio and video elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
