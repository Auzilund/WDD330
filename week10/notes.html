        <h3>Validating Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see<br>
                that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by <br>
                the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side <br>
                validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side <br>
                validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</li>
            <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've <br>
                discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally <br>
                doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better <br>
                performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript <br>
                validation.</li>
            <li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is <br>
                completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <h5>JS Validation</h5>
        <form name="myForm" action="" onsubmit="return validateForm()">
            Name: <input type="text" name="fname">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
        <br>
        <h5>Automatic HTML Validation</h5>
        <form action="">
        <input type="text" name="fname" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
        <p>If you click submit, without filling out the text field,<br>
            your browser will display an error message.</p>

        <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating <br>
                parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides <br>
                a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources <br>
                asynchronously across the network.</li>
            <li>The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if <br>
                the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server responds <br>
                with headers, the Promise will resolve normally (with the ok property of the <br>
                response set to false if the response isn’t in the range 200–299), and it will <br>
                only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.</li>
            <li>fetch() won’t send cross-origin cookies unless you set the credentials init option.</li>
        </ul>
